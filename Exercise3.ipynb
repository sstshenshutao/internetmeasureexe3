    "The development and support of a new transport protocol highly depends on\n",
    "the behaviors of hosts and middleboxes. A new transport protocol should accommodate the middleboxes and hosts deployed today\n",
    "in the Internet. To develop a new transport protocol with the support of middleboxes,\n",
    "the design should base on UDP or TCP. The UDP solution needs to implement many features, which are already implemented\n",
